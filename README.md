# JavaDataStructurePackageProj

This is my first attempt of creating a user defined package in java for data structures. The reason i decided to do that was that i thought that this was the easiest way to actually learn about data structures. Having that in mind i know that they probrably aren't the most efficient but i think they are still quite usable.
It currently contains:
Stack
Queue
LinkedList(singly)
DoublyLinkedList
